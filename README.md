# 🚀 Github Profile - Scrapper
>[!NOTE]
>This project uses scrapper to collect the names of the repositories of the github users and their link just by putting their username, then what it does is stop the data obtained to an XLSX which would be an excel document to analyze the data, clean it and create the appropriate graphs.
